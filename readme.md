# Breaking The Monolith

The purpose of this fork is to be a monolithic mess. 
You can use it to break and extract microservices.
As the PetClinic is continuously deployed you need to make small changes that preserve the behaviour.
The tasks involve refactoring, TDD, branch by abstraction and introducing an event bus.

Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/).
